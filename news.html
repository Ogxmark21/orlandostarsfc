            Report: Orlando Stars produced a thrilling performance on Sunday
            afternoon, coming from behind to secure a 3-2 victory against
            Liverpool FC at the Old trafford stadium. Just before halftime, our
            captain Anthony Lukaku equalised with a strong header after the
            visitors had taken an early lead in the 12th minute. With an
            incredible strike from outside the box in the second half, Salem
            Amad increased our lead and sent the home crowd into a frenzy.
            Substitute Shim Xhang was the hero, scored the game-winning goal in
            stoppage time to secure all three points, despite Liverpool trying
            the score late on.
